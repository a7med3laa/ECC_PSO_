#Secure Medical Images

- Application aims to secure medical data transmission by using ECC (Elliptic curve cryptography) public key cryptography for therapeutic images in IoT

- A PSO (particle swarm optimization) is used to get the optimal key for ECC encryption and decryption.

- The algorithm is based on the paper "Elhoseny, Mohamed, et al. "Hybrid optimization with cryptography encryption for medical image security in Internet of Things."
